# Virtual-Keyboard
It's a Virtual Keyboard. The keyboard will appear on your screen and you'll be able to type in mid-air. The accuracy isn't topnotch, but hey, it works!!!!!!!!!!! XD   Used Mediapipe for hand detection, cvzone(helps to run Image processing and AI functions),  pynput for taking keyboard input.  Steps are: detect my hand  track it find the position(coordinates) of my finger make a click mid-air find out where the click was made and print the button
